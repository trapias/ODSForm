###Newtonsoft.Json.dll
Note that version 01.00.07 does not include Newtonsoft library anymore, so if you are to install on DNN 6 you have to get it separately (download from [http://json.codeplex.com](http://json.codeplex.com/) ).

You don't need it if you're installing on DNN 7, that already ships the library in standard distribution.
